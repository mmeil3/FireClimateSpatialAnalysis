### Investigating Associations between British Columbia's Temperature and Fire Events in 2021: Point Pattern Analysis, Interpolation, and Regression
#### Michaela Meil: Advanced Spatial Analysis
#### December 2024

## Context

Wildfire has been the primary natural disturbance in the majority of British Columbia’s forests, and is predicted to be an increasing disturbance due to climate change (Zu, 2014). Four of the most severe wildfire seasons of the century have occurred in the past seven years: 2017, 2018, 2021, 2023 (Parisien et al., 2023). Factors such as temperature, precipitation, vegetation (mountain pine beetle outbreaks), timber harvest, soil condition, outdoor activities, and lack of traditional management practices all have significant impacts on wildfire (Stahl et al. 2006). While wildfires have significant effects on the landscape ecology, people living within British Columbia’s borders suffer from adverse health impacts from smoke, anxiety, and loss of neighborhood unity (Butry et al. 2001; Kochi et al. 2010).

## Identifying the Problem
The vast amount of factors influencing wildfires makes it challenging to understand why wildfires occur (Zu, 2014). Temperature has been used as an effective and significant factor in future wildfire occurrence modelling, with higher accuracy than precipitation (Zu, 2014).  In this statistical analysis, we take temperature data across the province of British Columbia, along with fire data for the year 2021 to ask: Can temperature explain wildfire occurence in British Columbia? Are these events clustered or dispersed?

## Study Site

British Columbia has 60 million hectares of forests and other natural vegetation types (i.e., grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands), and 76% of land is forested are characteristics that have shaped the area’s social, cultural, and economic identity (Parisien et al., 2023). BC’s forests have a full range of moisture, from temperate rainforests to high-desert woodlands; approx. 15% are considered dry, 31% wet, and 54% mesic (Parisien et al., 2023). There is also a small percentage of grasslands  (1%) and shrublands (7.2–12.5%). 
Since the 1950s, the number and area burned of wildfires had been steadily decreasing in the province until approximately 2000, due to a cooler and wetter climatic pattern mid-century. This makes the recent increase of wildfire activity surprising and concerning as the world witnessed some of the worst wildfire seasons to date in the last 7 years. Specifically in 2021, The warmest temperature ever recorded north of the 45th parallel (49.6 °C) occurred in the small town of Lytton, BC, on June 29, 2021 (Parisien et al., 2023). The following day a fire destroyed most of the community in minutes. The link between temperature and wildfire is evident here, along with the stark impacts it has on rural communities. 
 
### Descriptive Statistics	
 In our study, we take temperature data from 615 weather stations from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium BC Station Data, and 2,959 fire events from the BC Data Catalogue Wildfire Incident Locations - Historical Dataset. Average temperature ranges are between 0 and 20 degrees C (Figure 1). The mean centre was congregated in the mid-south/east section of British Columbia, which coincides with the Interior zone, which is home to numerous sensitive, alpine, and desert ecosystems that are extremely susceptible to wildfire (Figure 2), and most of the fires burned between Juny and July 2021 (Figure 3). There were many small-sized fires (ha) that burned in 2021, but few large-sized fires (ha) (Figure 4).

## Data Description
Our climate data was collected from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium BC Data Portal, where networks were selected for sufficient coverage of the Province. Data was collected from the BC Data Catalogue BC Wildfire Incident Locations - Historical Dataset. The year chosen to analyse was 2021, due to the extreme climate conditions, weather events, and destruction of communities that affected British Columbia drastically. This left us with 2959 fire event points, while analysing data from 615 weather stations across 4 Networks. As different networks have different naming conventions, a renaming process was employed to streamline data cleaning. For example, some columns were labeled “air_temperature” verus “air_temp”. We renamed all file and column names so that the air temperature data was able to be read effectively for each station across the province. You can view the code for how this was conducted below. 

```r

                      recursive = TRUE, #Search in subdirectories
                      ignore.case = TRUE) #Case-insensitive matching

# Step 2: Process each file

  # Step 5: Clean column names by trimming any extra spaces
  colnames(df) <- trimws(colnames(df))
  
  # Step 6: Rename columns that match variations of AirTemp
  # List possible variations of the column name
  column_variations <- c("air_temp", "air_temperature")
  
  # Loop through each variation and rename to 'AirTemp'

      colnames(df)[colnames(df) == var] <- "AirTemp"
      message("Renamed column '", var, "' to 'AirTemp' in file: ", basename(file))
    }
  }
  
  # Step 7: Save the cleaned data frame to a new file to avoid overwriting
  # Generate a new filename to avoid overwriting
  target_folder <- "C:/Users/micha/Documents/GEOG 418/Final Project/pcds_rename"

  # Step 8: Save the cleaned data frame to a new file
  write.csv(df, new_file_path, row.names = FALSE)
  
  # Optionally, print a message to confirm the file has been saved
  message("Processed file saved as: ", new_file_path)
}

```
### Additional Data Preparation of Events Data

In order to perform our analyses we outline in our methods, we also need to  take temperature averages for each station, map that station data (see Figure 1), create a density map of our events data, combine our temperature and fire data. That code is broken up into two sections below:

## Methods
In this tutorial, we employ a robust statistical analysis to understand if temperature helps explain the occurrence of wildfire. Our methods are broken up into Point Pattern Analysis, Interpolation, and Regression.

### Point Pattern Analysis
We evaluated spatial distribution of fires, to determine if points are clustered, dispersed, or random. We employ three methods to complete our point pattern analysis: Nearest Neighbour Analysis (NNA), Quadrat Analysis, and k-function.

```
##### Nearest Neighbour Analysis
NNA uses the Nearest Neighbourhood Distance to understand how observations of interest are distributed across British Columbia (Zu, 2014, p. 14). We can compare the mean NND to another random NND to determine whether our pattern is clustered, dispersed, or random. When NND values are close to zero values are random. When the values are larger than 0 they are dispersed, and smaller than 0 they are clustered (Zu, 2014, p. 14).

Null: The location of British Columbia fires are randomly distributed.

Alternate: The location of British Columbia fires are not randomly distributed (Dispersed or Clustered)

The average nearest neighbour value for a spatially random distribution is calculated using the following equation:

$$ 
\bar{NND_R} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\text{Density}}} \\
\bar{NND_D} = \frac{1.07453}{\sqrt{\text{Density}}}
$$

$$ 
Z_n = \frac{\bar{NND} - \bar{NND_R}}{\sigma \bar{NND}}
$$

You can view the code to perform your Nearest Neighbour Analysis here:
```r
# Nearest Neighbour Analysis
nearestNeighbour <- nndist(event.ppp)
nearestNeighbour <- as.data.frame(as.numeric(nearestNeighbour))
colnames(nearestNeighbour) <- "Distance"

nnd <- mean(nearestNeighbour$Distance)
studyArea <- area.owin(event.ppp$window)
pointDensity <- nrow(nearestNeighbour) / studyArea
r_nnd <- 1 / (2 * sqrt(pointDensity))
d_nnd <- 1.07453 / sqrt(pointDensity)
R <- nnd / r_nnd
SE_NND <- 0.26136 / sqrt(nrow(nearestNeighbour) * pointDensity)
z <- (nnd - r_nnd) / SE_NND

nnd_results <- data.frame(StudyArea = studyArea, MeanNND = nnd, RandomNND = r_nnd, Z = z, R = R)
print(nnd_results)
```

#### Quadrat Analysis

The Quadrat function method determines the point distribution by examining its density over British Columbia. We can compare observed distributions with random patterns to assess whether our pattern is clustered, dispersed, or random (Oyana, 2021). The formula and the code for performing a quadrat analysis is listed below. 

$$
VAR = \frac{\Sigma f_ix_i^2 - [\frac{(\Sigma f_ix_i)^2}{m}]}{m-1}
$$

where the number of points per cell is x, where f is frequency, where m is the number of quadrats. 

Null: The distribution of points follows a CSR pattern.

Alternate: The distribution of points does not follow a random pattern (dispersion or clustering).
```r
# Quadrat Analysis
qcount <- quadratcount(event.ppp, nx = 10, ny = 10)
qcount_df <- as.data.frame(qcount)
qcount_df <- plyr::count(qcount_df, 'Freq')
colnames(qcount_df) <- c("x", "f")

sum_fx2 <- sum(qcount_df$f * (qcount_df$x^2))
M <- sum(qcount_df$f)
N <- sum(qcount_df$x * qcount_df$f)
sum_fx_sq <- (sum(qcount_df$x * qcount_df$f))^2

VAR <- (sum_fx2 - (sum_fx_sq / M)) / (M - 1)
MEAN <- N / M
VMR <- VAR / MEAN
chi_square <- VMR * (M - 1)
p <- 1 - pchisq(chi_square, M - 1)

quadrat_results <- data.frame(Variance = VAR, Mean = MEAN, VMR = VMR, Chisquare = chi_square, Pvalue = p)
print(quadrat_results)
```
#### Ripley's k-Function

K-function explores a spatial pattern across a range of spatial events, rather than relying on distances to the closest events (Oyana, 2021). It is based on all interevent distances between observation points and summarised to fit the model that best suits the spatial pattern of British Columbia.

Null: British Columbia fires are randomly distributed in space at all distances.

Alternate: British Columbia fires are not randomly distributed in space at all distances (Dispersed or Clustered).

The equation for this calculation is:

$$
K(d) = \lambda^{-1}E(N_d)
$$

```r
# K-Function Analysis
k <- Kest(event.ppp, correction = "Ripley")
envelope_k <- envelope(event.ppp, Kest, nsim = 99)
plot(envelope_k)
```
### Interpolation

### Semivariogram
The shape of a variogram helps us describe how the data is spatially autocorrelated. There are three main components that are important for interpreting the results of a semivariogram model: the sill, nugget, and range (Oyana, 263, p. 284). The sill being when the curve levels off, the nugget is for values that are very close to zero, this gives us an idea of the noise in our data. This is not necessarily a measurement error, but reminds us that some values that are close together may not be identical. The range is the distance from where the variogram first reaches, to where it levels off, where there is no more spatial autocorrelation. 

#### Inverse Weighted Distance

We then created a density surface for temperature using the point data from the weather stations across the province. The Inverse Distance Weighting method was employed to estimate a surface. IDW is a deterministic interpolation technique that estimates the values of unsampled points from values at nearby locations (Oyana, 2021, p. 282). This helps predict values where measurements are not available. It’s important to note it is topographically sensitive. We interpret the results from our interpolated surface visually.

The formula below is used to calculate a surface: 
$$ 
Z_i = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_j}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{ij}^p}
$$

where Zj is the value at location j, dij is the distance between points i and j, and p is a power exponent that controls the degree to which weights are controlled by distance.


To create this interpolated surface, please use the code below:

### Regression

Regression analysis generates coefficients that try to best fit a line with the observed data points (Oyana, 2021, p. 148). The relationship is confirmed when the dependent varies with the independent variable, or when there is scattering around the chosen model. It is best to take a two-tiered approach that involves Least Squares Regression  (LSR) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) (Oyana, 2021, 149). 

#### Ordinary Least Squares Regression
Least Squares Regression modelling helps identify important predictors that may explain the spatial processes in a given area, while taking into consideration the residuals. We are interested in looking at the overall patterns that suggest a linear relationship, to understand how much temperature explains wildfire. The residuals are then tested in the model and are randomly distributed (Oyana, 2021, p. 149). We then test for a GLobal Moran's I to see if there is positive spatial autocorrelation.

A simple regression model can be written as follows:

$$
Y = a + bX
$$ 

Null: Temperature (Independent Variable) has no effect on fire occurrence (dependent variable)
Alternate: Temperature has a significant effect on fire occurence

```r
# Read the shapefile
final_data_sf <- st_read("final_data.shp")

# Fit the OLS regression model on the entire spatial data
# Use "temprtr" instead of "temperature"
ols_model <- lm(fires ~ temprtr, data = final_data_sf)

# Add residuals to the original spatial data frame
final_data_sf$residuals <- resid(ols_model)

# Inspect the updated spatial object to verify residuals are added
print(head(final_data_sf))

# (Optional) Save the updated shapefile with residuals
st_write(final_data_sf, "final_data_with_residuals.shp", delete_dsn = TRUE)

# Create a map of residuals from the OLS regression
ggplot(data = final_data_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = residuals)) + # Map the residuals to fill color
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C", name = "Residuals") + # Use a color scale
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Map of Residuals from OLS Regression",
       fill = "Residuals") +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

# Optional: Save the plot if desired
ggsave("residuals_map.png", width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 300)

```
#### Geographically Weighted Regression
If the Least Squares Regression model revealed evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable, we can proceed with fitting a Geographically Weighted Regression model. GWR allows us to quantify how temperature influences wildfire density in British Columbia using these coefficients and residuals (Oyana, 2021, p. 150). 

$$
Y_{uv} = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{uv} + \beta_2 E_{uv} + \beta_3 A_{uv} + \epsilon_{uv}
$$

Where:
- \( Y_{uv} \) is the dependent variable (for example, wildfire occurrence or intensity).
- \( X_{uv}, E_{uv}, A_{uv} \) are independent variables (for example, temperature, elevation, and area).
- \( \alpha \) is the intercept.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3 \) are the coefficients for the independent variables.
- \( \epsilon_{uv} \) represents the error term.

## Discussion

## Results
### Point Pattern Analysis
The NNDMean and NNDRandom  values from this test indicate that wildfire events in British Columbia are spatially clustered. This result shows strong evidence of significant clustering as indicated by the z-score of -65.2628 (see Figure 7). Therefore, we reject our null hypothesis.The quadrat analysis results indicate that wildfires have a clustered spatial distribution, with strong evidence that the clustering is statistically significant as indicated by the chi square value of 12866. 6506, which produces a p-value \< 0.0001 (see Figure 8). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. Please see the K-Function results for wildfire events in 2021 (Figure 9). They appear to be significantly spatially clustered at distances greater than 10,000 metres. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

Our interpolated surface of climate in British Columbia helps us create a temperature average for the province, even from unknown points. In the northern region, we see cooler temperature averages between 8 and 12 degrees. It is important to note here that there was less station coverage over the northern half of the province, so results may be slightly distorted. We see high temperature values in the southern interior of the province, as well as the eastern coast of Vancouver Island and the lower mainland. This corresponds with expected climate zones of these areas. For the semivariogram, We chose an exponential model to communicate the degree of spatial autocorrelation present in our dataset. The semivariogram has a psill value of 10.74561, and a range of 7010.943. There is very little noise as the space between the nugget and sill is quite small.

### Regression

#### Least Squares Regression
Our F statistic is 188.2 and is less than our critical value at (1, 465) degrees of freedom, and an extremely small p-value at 2^-16 Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

#### Geographically Weighted Regression

GWR: From our Ordinary Least Squares Model, we determined that Temperature does have a significant amount of spatial dependency on fire, so there is a need to construct a local statistic to explain the variations (Oyana, 2021). Our results from the Geographically Weighted Regression leave us with every cell to have its own R2 and pvalue that are mapped, as seen in Figure x.  Our Local R2 has a mean of 39.9%. This indicates that 36.9% of the variance in the dependent variable (fires) can be explained by our GWR for the province of British Columbia. 

### Summary

Overall, our statistical analysis of point pattern analysis, interpolation, and regression can answer the two research questions we outlined at the beginning: Can temperature explain wildfire occurrence in British Columbia? Are these events clustered or dispersed? Our results showed significant clustering of wildfire events. We also concluded that temperature does a moderate job at explaining wildfire occurrence. While temperature is not an entirely effective marker of wildfire, this is to be expected as extreme weather events are impacted by precipitation, humidity, vegetation, logging activities, and a lack of traditional management activities (Stahl et al. 2006). It's difficult to understand a complex environmental mosaic by looking at only one variable. 

While our analysis was robust, some shortcomings were noted. We were only using one variable (temperature), one year of data, and noticed a lack of weather station coverage. While we know temperature is an important variable, many other factors contribute to the spread of wildfire. We also only used one year of data. While this year was important due to the severe temperature and fire events that occured in the province, specifically Lytton, British Columbia, this limits our scope of understanding of climate and wildlife trends.  While we can go off of previous literature to supplement this, a more robust statistical analysis could use more historical fire data. Lastly, there are signficantly less weather stations in the northern half of the province, sparking challenges to getting full climate coverage of the province. Perhaps moving away from the PCDS source to other smaller weather stations up north would be worthwhile, but is likely another project all in itselt to build a database of adequetely dispered weather stations. Previous literature has outlined trends in wildfire increased by looking at a larger temporal scale (Parisien et al., 2023), some employ temperature along with relative humidity for more detailed results (Ozelkan et al, 2015)
